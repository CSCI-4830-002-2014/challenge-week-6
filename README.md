[SQL vs. NoSQL: Which Is Better?](http://news.dice.com/2012/07/16/sql-vs-nosql-which-is-better/)

## What are the limitations of SQL? How are NoSQL solutions trying to address them (name three)? (7 points)

Joins is relational databases are very very slow.

Relational data has poor compatibilty with the complex data structures we typically use.

Relational data doesn't map well.

No SQL uses a nonrelational system to store data, and thus doesn't deal with these problems.

Colorado has sales of $132.2k. The closest four are Arizona at $120.4k, Maryland at $124.9k, Alabama at 126.7k, and New Jersey at 143.4k.

Colorado is the smallest of the five in annual sales growth within consumer furniture, within small business technology, it is the largest, and within consumer office supplies, it is also the largest. Unsurprisingly, these correlate with the number of items in each of these sectors.
