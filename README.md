## What are the limitations of SQL? How are NoSQL solutions trying to address them (name three)? (7 points)

SQL must have a fxed set of columns which makes it hard to support, for example, tables where rows have dissimilar columns. 
Also, the max memory that can be utilized by an SQL server engine is 1 GB.
Along with this, you can only vertically scale SQL performance wise on one computer.
