# What is the most difficult part about this week's challenge?

I had a tough time getting MongoDB setup in OS X, and eventually gave up and ran it in a VM. I apologize in advance for the incomplete-ness of this challenge, this past week has been very busy for me.

[Comparing SPARQL with SQL](http://www.topquadrant.com/2014/05/05/comparing-sparql-with-sql/)

## What are the limitations of SQL? How are NoSQL solutions trying to address them (name three)? (7 points)

SQL data is very structured by nature. NoSQL solves this by storing a variety of data, including unstructured data, allowing for much more flexibility in the information stored. SQL databases also require pre-defined schemas, which NoSQL does not. Another big advantage of NoSQL is the ability to manipulate data using object-oriented API's rather than the traditional structured query language.
