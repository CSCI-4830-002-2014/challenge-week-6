## What are the limitations of SQL? How are NoSQL solutions trying to address them (name three)? (7 points)

Although SQL has been around longer and may be generally easy to distribute horizontally over different servers, it may be difficult to store complex data types. In general NoSQL advantages include:
1. Document stores support more complex data than the key-value stores.
2. NoSQL systems generally support secondary indexes and multiple types of documents (objects) per database, and nested documents or lists.
3. Document stores provide a mechanism to query collections based on multiple attribute value constraints.
Depending on the type of NoSQL database that is used, it may be possible to achieve a similar level of concurrency and horizontal scalability as a traditional SQL data store.

{LA and Miami were both cities that had large sales but relatively low profits.  This is clear because the graphical diameter of these cities are large but they are not very green (which indicate low profits with this color scale).}

### 2 (5 points)

{Corporate technology generated the highest total profit, as evidenced by the color and text label.}

### 3 (5 points)

{The Republic of Korea had relatively less sales in their office supplies and Brazil could use more sales in furniture. }

### 4 (5 points)

{Durango has been loosing profits in the Home Office segment for the delivery truck method and Boise has lost profits in the consumer segment for Regular Air.}

### 5 (5 points)

{Texas significantly outperformed California in terms of profit in the consumer segment.}

### 6 (5 points)

![image](tc6.png?raw=true)

{On average, California, Colorado, and Washington appear to be paying a much higher price by unit to ship via delivery truck.}

### 7 (5 points)

![image](tc7.png?raw=true)

{When comparing Colorado to other states with a similar market size (measured by total sales), it is clear that we are different in that we have very poor profits and low quantity of sales of home office via delivery truck.  On the other hand, for all consumer segments, the most orders are shipped via regular air and generally have better profits than other shipping methods.}
