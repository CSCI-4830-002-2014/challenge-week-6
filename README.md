## What are the limitations of SQL? How are NoSQL solutions trying to address them (name three)? (7 points)

1. SQL cannot scale horizontally easily (across multiple servers). NoSQL shards data to create clusters that can easily exist on multiple machines.
2. SQL databases have predefineds schema that can't be easily changed. NoSQL doesn't have a set structure, so it can be changed at any time.
3. SQL databases are expensive to maintain. NoSQL often involves simpler data models that require less maintenance by DBA's.
