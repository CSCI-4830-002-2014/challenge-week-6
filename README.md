Greece, Sweden

We're looking for circles that have one real tiny slice. There are many cases as you can see in the image. I found Greece and Sweden as two very extreme cases.

In the 'Consumer' column we see a red color for california meaning that profit is low comparing to green color for Texas. However, the total profit for California in this case is $18,077 whereas that of Texas is $16,265 meaning that California actually did better than Texas. It could be an error specially since we see parentheses around the profit in 'Consumer' for California. The real correct answer is 'Corporate', I believe, as the difference is significantly higher.

Comparing Colorado to Wisconsin, New Jersey, Meryland and Albama who are in the same category in terms of total sales. Colorado's total sales is $131,000 and sits in $121,000-$150,000 range along with other four peers. I think all of the messures will be different. Sales, annual sales growth, discount, gross profit ratio, order quantity, profit, etc. Same goes with dimensions.

Colorado's per capita income is on the highest range 31,300 to 49,500
