## What are the limitations of SQL? How are NoSQL solutions trying to address them (name three)? (7 points)

1. The approach and emphasis on structured data and data integrity makes it
harder to deal with evolving datasets. Creating new tables and rows constantly
for new data types can be unrealistic in some situations.

2. Clustering relational databases has proven to be a challenge. For example,
having many nodes can be challenging as faults can happen during replication.
This means they are only really fit to scale vertically unlike NoSQL databases
which are often engineered to scale horizontally.

3. NoSQL databases have better support for actions to reduce/compress/map data.
This means that data can be aggregated and thus not have to store countless
individual records. This makes data analysis faster for massive data sets.

Columbia: Similar amount of sales; however, seemed to by significantly more
Copiers and Fax machines, and much less office in terms of office manchines.

Pakiston: Almost no Copiers and Fax category were sold despite being similar
in sales!
