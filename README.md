[SQL vs NoSQL Database Differences Explained with few Example DB](http://www.thegeekstuff.com/2014/01/sql-vs-nosql-db/)

## What are the limitations of SQL? How are NoSQL solutions trying to address them (name three)? (7 points)

Some limitations of SQL are 1) it must follow pre-defined schemas. NoSQL databases like MongoDB try to address this by allowing you to change the schema without changing the actual data. 2) SQL only deals in atomic valus. NoSQL databases address this issue by not requiring as rigid a structure to the data; Redis has data structures that can be extended. 3) SQL is not a good fit for storing hierarchical data, where NoSQL databases use the key-value pair way of storing data which is much better suited to storing hierarchical data

The three cities that I found had higher sales but lower profit were San Diego, CA, Atlanta, GA, and Miami, FL. The colors of the circles were in the gray area, which means that they are making a lackluster profit at best. However, the size of the circles over these cities is significantly larger than other cities making the same level of profit. This indicates these are high-sales and low-profit regions. One connection I see with these cities is that they are areas frequented by tourists. San Diego and Miami are beach tourist destinations.

The corporate customer segment and the technology department far and away generated the highes total profit because it has the highest amount of sales (as indicated by the label) and the highest profit (as indicated by the dark green coloring of the cell). This is probably because corporate customers are high-volume buyers, and technology is a product that is both in high demand and expensive.

The three countries that are similar to Egypt in volume, but struggle to generate profit in one department are Argentina, Brazil and France. Argentina and Brazil particularly struggle in generating profit through the technology department. This is because these countries are poorer, more remote and they do not have the most advanced power grids. Thus, technology is not a good investment for them. France is a bit of a mystery. I guess because they are a more developed country that cares about minimizing waste, it minimizes its purchases of office supplies.

Galesburg, IL and Durango, CO have been losing significant amounts of money in the Home Office segmenent and the Delivery Truck ship mode. Hattiesburg, MS and Bozeman, MT have been losing significant amounts of money in the Home Office Segment and the Regular Air shipment mode. Boise, ID has been losing a significant amount of the money in the Consumer segment and the Regular Air ship mode.

Texas significantly outperformed California in the Consumer market segment. California, judging by the pinkish coloring, has lost a fair amount of money in that segment, whereas Texas, judging by its light green shading, has made a good profit in that segment. Texas has a lot more Big Box Stores and is not as concerned with its environmental footprint as California is, which is why the consumer segment is doing so well there.

My boss is correct. The above visulaization shows the seven most expensive states to ship to toward the right, and the cheapest seven states to ship to toward the left. It costs about double to ship to the seven most expensive states than the two least expensive states, and even in the middle there is roughly a five dollar difference between the seventh least expensive state and the seventh most expensive state. This is well-illustrated by the stark color contrast between New Mexico and Indiana. I find it humorous that it costs almost double to ship to South Dakota as compared to North Dakota.

I compared all of the states in total sales in ascending order, and I chose the two states to the left of Colorado (Maryland and Alabama) and the two states to the right of Colorado (New Jersey and Wisconsin). According to my visualization, Wisconsin, Maryland and New Jersey are significantly more profitable than Colorado on an average profit basis. Like Alabama and Minnesota, Colorado gets the highest amount of sales from Technology. Compared to everyone else except Alabama, Colorado makes a pretty dismal average profit on Technology, especially when the sales volume is taken into account. However, Colorado has the highest average profit when it comes to furniture sales.
