# What is the most difficult part about this week's challenge?

Question 3 of MongoDB took a very long time. I got stuck with my code blocking for a long time before I could get it to work.

## What are the limitations of SQL? How are NoSQL solutions trying to address them (name three)? (7 points)

1. Scalability: A SQL database in order to scale must make the central server capable of handling more and more queries. In order to do this among multiple servers is more difficult. NoSQL databases usually allow for horizontal growth of the number of databases without much additional effort.

2. Robustness: A SQL database is similar to a spreadsheet in that each key entry has a single value that can represent many things. A NoSQL database can be a key that points to a document of many values, that do not need to be defined during database creation.

3. Fast Development: A SQL database must be predefined with the database schema on creation. A NoSQL database allows for adding additional fields on the fly, which is meant to increase uptime and ease of database management.

In order to make the visualization for this question I used a filter in order to filter out some of the cities that are making a lot of profit, because this gives better resolution to the data points with lower profit. If an addition filter is put in to only show cities that have significant sales, two striking data points come out showing two cities with high sales and negative profit. Those two cities are San Diego, California and Miamia, Florida.

The visualization by Tableau that shades the segment with the most profit made it very obvious that the corporate-technology sector generated the most profit. This makes sense since corporations have the funds to purchase a lot of technology and technology usually is expensive.

The graphic definitely is a picture worth a thousand words, but I will point out some highlights in the graph. In Bozeman, Montana regular-air for home businesses creates a large net loss. Washington D.C. makes a large profit for regular-air for small businesses. For corporate deliveries, it seems that delivery trucks will cause a net loss more often than any other transport method.

Texas significantly outperformed California in the consumer segment.

Is the map visualization it can be seen that the average shipping cost for shipping by ground is significantly higher than any of the other segments. Within the shipping by ground catagory the states that have the highest shipping costs are usually the states that are far from major shipping centers.

From this visualization it can be seen that Colorado has a relatively high shipping cost compared to most other states with the same amount of total sales. The main source of sales for Colorado, and for Arkansas is furniture, which could be the reason why the shipping costs are so high. Unlike Arkansas however, Colorado is as profitable as some of the states whose main form of sales comes from technology, which is usually seems as a profitable kind of business.
