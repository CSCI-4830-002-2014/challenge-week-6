It would appear that the cities with the widest gap between how much they sell and their profit rates are Los Angeles and New York City. Both cities have sales on the right side of half a million dollars, but NYC is profiting less than $40,000 and LA less than $16,000, both of which are substantially less than what they are selling.

As seen in the image, corporations in the technology sector are far above other departments by more than double with profits higher than $1.3 million, with the exception of small businesses in a far second place at $800,000. Technology is clearly the department to be in, and the corporate segment is generating a much higher profit than others.

France and the Republic of Korea seem fairly similar in terms of total sales when in comparison to Egypt, but (similar to Egypt as well), these countries are struggling in the office supplies department, with less than 30% of France's and less than 25% of Korea's total sales being brought in through office supplies.

Galesburg, IL and Durango, CO are suffering greatly in the delivery of home office supplies by truck, and Hattiesburg, MS and Bozeman, MT are also not doing well in the delivery of home office, but by regular air. All of these cities are in debt of at least $10,000 or more.

The only customer segment that Texas "significantly" outperformed California in terms of total profits would be in the consumer section, in which there is a difference of over $34,000.

It would appear that my boss is correct. California, Colorado, and Illinois are all doing poorly when it comes to delivery by truck, especially in the consumer and home office sectors.

Compared to similar states in terms of total sales, Colorado provides the lowest average discount rate out of the comparable states. Colorado also has one of the smallest profit margins when compared to similar states, and is even losing profit in the home office segment. The state is, however, doing well with profits in the small business and corporate worlds.
The most notable thing is the fact that in consumer and corporate express air, and (very much so) in ground delivery of home office, Colorado is losing profits. Efforts should be made in these areas to reverse this and start gaining profits.
