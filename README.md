[SQL vs. NoSQL- What You Need to Know](http://dataconomy.com/sql-vs-nosql-need-know/)

## What are the limitations of SQL? How are NoSQL solutions trying to address them (name three)? (7 points)

SQL has fixed schemas. Scaling is verticle. You must use a specific language to query the database.

NoSQL has no fixed schema, you can scale horizontally and in NoSQL you can modify an api to fit your needs.
