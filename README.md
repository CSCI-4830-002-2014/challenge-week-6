[SQL vs. NoSQL: Which Is Better?](http://news.dice.com/2012/07/16/sql-vs-nosql-which-is-better/)

## What are the limitations of SQL? How are NoSQL solutions trying to address them (name three)? (7 points)

1.) Joining large sets are a pain in SQL. NoSQL fixes this by distributing the work on multiple nodes.
2.) Definitions are also important in SQL. NoSQL allows dynamic data for all unstructured data.
3.) Accessing the databases is difficult in SQL. NoSQL are significantly easier to deal with.

Dallas and San Diego are two of the largest cities with a lot of sales. However these two cities have the least amount of profit considering how much more they are selling. The visualization shows that large dots and lighter dots fits what we are looking for.

France and Egypt were close in terms of sales and France didn't make a lot of sales in the office supplies sector. Korea has sales closest to Egypt but sold very little supplies.

Durango is losing the most amount of money with how close they are to home. Bozeman Montana lost a lot of profit in the home office portion shipped by regular air.  Both of these deficincies could be due to where they are geographically. Red dots show this on the visualization.

The only part of this graph that shows one state out-performing the other would be in the consumer part. TX killed this where CA lost money instead of making money.

My visualization shows that Montana is significantly expensive to deliver on the ground. Montana should be delivering by air considering that is is about the same as all the other states and if it did deliver on the ground then it is just too expensive on their part.

In this visualization, it shows Colorado's total sales were $132,210 but also note that CO has very little discounts. There are states that are similar to CO but it just depends on the profitable customer part. Some have small businesses while corporate companies have made big profits.
